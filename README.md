# Any2English -  Multi-Lingual Video to English Dub with Lip Sync



## Overview

The Multi-Lingual Video Dubber is a powerful tool designed to dub videos in various languages to English while ensuring lip sync. This GitHub repository contains the necessary code and resources to achieve this task. It utilizes several libraries and models, including Whisper for language translation, Tortoise TTS for text-to-speech conversion with customizable voices, and Wav2Lip for accurate lip synchronization. Please note that due to resource requirements, the current version only supports small videos.


## How it Works

1. **Audio Extraction**: The first step of the process involves extracting the audio from the input video file.

2. **Language Translation**: The extracted audio is then passed through Whisper, a language translation library, to convert it to English.

3. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Tortoise TTS is employed to convert the English text into speech. By default, the Tom voice is used, but users have the option to choose from a selection of other voices.

4. **Lip Synchronization**: Wav2Lip, a lip synchronization model, is used to sync the generated English speech with the input video, ensuring that the dubbed video's lip movements match the spoken words.


## Requirements

Due to resource-intensive processes, the current version supports only small videos. To use the tool, follow these steps:

1. Upload your video and audio files to Google Drive.
2. Use the provided notebook on Google Colab.
3. Follow the easy steps outlined in the notebook to generate the English-dubbed video with lip sync.

## Usage
